# Impact-Induced Melting and Mixing for Planetary Collisions

## Overview

This is by far the largest project I have taken on at the Nakajima Lab, encompassing 400+ hours of work alone.  This work is aimed at estimating the amount of melting that occurs in the target body's mantle during a collision, as well as how much of the impactor's iron core mixes with the target body's mantle.  The latter is especially important, as the iron particles that remain in the mantle can have effects on the core and mantle compositions, and subsequently the dynamo history and volatile cycle.  Previously, Nakajima developed heat scaling laws that described the amount of melting and its spatial geometry in the target mantle post-collision for collisions with impactor-to-total mass ratios (γ) above 0.03 (Nakajima et al. 2015).  My main task is to test and extend this scaling law to lower values of γ.  Previous work has also been done to estimate the amount of impactor iron in the target mantle for impact velocities of 1.2 and 1.7 times the system's mutual escape velocity (e.g., Marchi et al. 2018).  Here, we extend these studies to a lower impact velocity equal to the system escape velocity.
