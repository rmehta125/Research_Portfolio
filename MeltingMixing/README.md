# Impact-Induced Melting and Mixing for Planetary Collisions

## Overview

This is by far the largest project I have taken on at the Nakajima Lab, encompassing 300+ hours of work alone.  This work is aimed at estimating the amount of melting that occurs in the target body's mantle during a collision, as well as how much of the impactor's iron core mixes with the target body's mantle.  The latter is
