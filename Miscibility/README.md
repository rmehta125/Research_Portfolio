## Overview

This is a relatively new project I have taken on, now that my analysis of impact-induced melting and mixing begins to draw to a close (see the MeltingMixing folder of this repository).  The main goal is to understand the composition of a body following a massive impact.  In particular, we are interested in how miscibility plays a role in the material distribution and the structure of the resulting body.  Miscibility can be understood as the ability of a material to mix and homogenize with the ambient material surrounding it.  This property is highly dependent on the relationship between temperature and pressure.  For this project, I have so far simulated a large impact and plotted the temperature and pressure distributions, and used them to determine which particles are miscible.  Further detail is described below.
