# SPH Simulation Analysis

## Overview

**For an in-depth summary of the contents of this repository and the work I have completed so far, please see the ResearchPortfolio.pdf file.**

This repository contains all work I, Roshan Mehta, have done for the Nakajima Lab under the supervision of Prof. Miki Nakajima.  My research involves using smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations to analyze giant impacts.  SPH is a Lagrangian technique that treats particle systems as fluids.  I use this method to generate high resolution simulations of planetary collisions, which I then analyze for melting, material mixing, various properties such as temperature and pressure distributions, and more.  My programs and findings are stored in this repository.  In addition, I have included instruction manuals in the MeltingMixing and VisualizationCode folders explaining how to use the code included there, as these are programs I wrote for others to use as well.  

## Gallery

Shown below are a random assortment of plots and animations that I have generated so far using the code (or variations of it) provided in this repository.  Additional figures can be found in the individual project folders.
