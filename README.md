# SPH Simulation Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains all work I, Roshan Mehta, have done for the Nakajima Lab under the supervision of Prof. Miki Nakajima.  The contents included here represent the polished outcomes of 600+ hours of work. My research involves using smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations to analyze giant impacts.  SPH is a Lagrangian technique that treats particle systems as fluids.  I use this method to generate high resolution simulations of planetary collisions, which I then analyze for melting, material mixing, various properties such as temperature and pressure distributions, and more.  My programs and findings are stored in this repository.  In addition, I have included instruction manuals in the MeltingMixing and VisualizationCode folders explaining how to use the code included there, as these are programs I wrote for others to use as well.  

## Gallery

Shown below are a random assortment of plots and animations that I have created so far using the code (or variations of it) provided in this repository.  I generated all data visualized here using the Nakajima Lab's SPH code (https://github.com/NatsukiHosono/FDPS_SPH) and BlueHive, the University of Rochester supercomputer.  Additional figures can be found in the individual project folders.
