# Analysis of Mantle Melting for a Collision Between Two Half-Moon Sized Bodies

## Overview

This is a small project I worked on to help a postdoctoral researcher, Thea Fardini, on her current project.  Fardini is studying the amount of tidal heating that occurs in a system with multiple moonlets before they collide.  As such, she needed a baseline of the amount of heating and melting that occurs during a collision.  This is especially relevant to our Earth-Moon system, as zircons have been discovered on the Moon that are around 100 Myr younger than the Moon itself, indicating that the material was molten 100 Myr after formation.  My task was to create an example collision between two bodies, each with half the mass of the Moon, and analyze the amount of melting that occurs in the mantle.

## Methods

The parameters for the collision are shown below.
