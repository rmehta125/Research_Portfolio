## Overview

This is a project I worked on to help a graduate student, Nicholas Litza, study the formation of the South Pole-Aitken basin on the Moon (SPA).  The SPA basin is a massive impact crater on the far side of the Moon, estimated to be over 2500 km in diameter.  Litza was studying how this impact feature formed with the use of a simulation software known as iSALE.  However, he ran into limitations, as iSALE simulates in 2 dimensions.  Hence, I helped by generating a 3D simulation using SPH.

## Methods

The impact parameters used are shown below.

The impactor was assumed to have a radius of 200 km and no core.  For this project, I analyzed the pressure and energy delievered during the collision and visualized the effect of the impact on the lunar body.
