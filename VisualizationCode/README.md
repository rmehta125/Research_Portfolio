# Visualization Code to Generate 3D Renders and Cross Sections

## Overview

This folder contains visualization programs I have written for the Nakajima Lab.  The code allows users to generate 3D renders, cross sections, and animations of planetary collisions simulated using SPH code.  Previously, lab members used a visualization software called Zindaiji.  Although this tool was very powerful, it was also complex, prone to crashing, and difficult to learn.  The summer that I joined the lab, I taught myself how to use Zindaiji and documented my findings in an instruction manual (see the CMAP folder of this repository).  However, Prof. Nakajima and I thought it would still be useful to have a simpler option for visualization.  As such, I created the programs in this folder for others to use for visualizing their simulations.  I also wrote a manual for how to use the code (see the Vis_Code_Instructions.pdf file in this folder).  This visualization code has been published in the Nakajima Lab's SPH code in the drift_test and resume_test branches (https://github.com/NatsukiHosono/FDPS_SPH/tree/drift_test/examples/example_with_pipeline).  A few sample renders that I have generated with these programs are shown below, as well as in the gallery in the main README.md file of this repository.
